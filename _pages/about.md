I am an Australian biologist with an interest in the genetic basis of evolution and the feedbacks between demographic and genetic processes. I did my master's degree in the [Hoffmann group](https://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/hoffmann-group) at the University of Melbourne. I then went on to obtain my PhD working with the [Mikheyev group](https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/research-groups/mikheyev-group-evolutionary-genomics), researching the molecular and phenotypic evolution of a [critically endangered insect](https://www.zoo.org.au/fighting-extinction/local-threatened-species/lord-howe-island-stick-insect/) in a captive breeding program. For this I collaborated with the conservation management team at [Zoos Victoria](https://www.zoo.org.au/). Currently, I study the interactions of wild and farmed salmon as a postdoctoral researcher at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/) in Ireland, where I'm advised by Drs. Tom Reed and Phil McGinnity. I am affiliated with the [Irish Marine Institute *Foras na mara*](https://www.marine.ie/).

In general, my research can be grouped into a few thematic areas:
- Identifying the genetic basis of fitness variation in complex organisms
- Characterising molecular evolutionary patterns in wild/non-model populations
- Applying molecular genetic tools to answer questions in conservation and industrial (agri/aqua/silvicultural) contexts

I have experience generating and interpreting large and small molecular genetic datasets, and I enjoy contributing a molecular perspective to projects that might otherwise not include one. If you've got (or want to get) genetic marker data and need a collaborating geneticist, get in touch.

Aside from my work, I like to cook, boulder, play the piano, read, hike, run, and sing.
